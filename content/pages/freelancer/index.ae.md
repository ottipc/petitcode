# Want to join petitcode?

Being a freelancer and working remotely is a dream for many, but a reality for only a few due to several reasons. Through petitcode, all senior freelancers can gather together and focus in their field of expertise and interest only.

Are you a freelancer, work remotely and have references to back your seniority? If you enjoy the concept of petitcode, you can get in touch with us. Just ensure that you have a recommendation from a third person. This can be from a fellow freelancer, former colleague, boss or client.
