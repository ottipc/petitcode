### User interface design

The **user interface (UI)** is where and how humans interact with the functioning software. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the software from the user's end.

Generally, the goal is to produce an interface which makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable to operate any software or device in the way which produces the desired outcome. This means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the human.

### User experience design

**User experience** (**UX**) refers to a person's emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system or service. It includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human--software interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person's perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency. User experience may be considered subjective in nature to the degree that it is about individual perception and thought with respect to the system. User experience is dynamic as it is constantly evolving over time due to changing usage circumstances and changes to individual systems as well as the wider usage context in which they can be found. In the end, user experience is about how the user interacts with and experiences the product.

## What is the difference between a graphic designer, UI/UX and a front end developer

Graphic designers already existed in the 19th Century and have mostly been involved in Branding and Print mediums, such as logos, posters, flyers, brochures, billboards. As digital media and formats were introduced, graphic designers expanded their fields of action and expertise. Therefore we can say that UI and UX are a specialisation of graphic design.

As [previously mentioned](http://petitcode.com/), a front end developer is responsible for the component controlled by the end user, the user interface, which serves as layer of make-up for the server side of the software. The developer may have design skills but that is not their primary skill.

## Quality principles

It is petitcode's strong belief, that, in order to design the best user interface for your business, it is important to consider several aspects and break down this process in steps:

1.  **Analyse your business** - do you provide a product or a service? According to your Corporate Identity, how do you present yourself to your customers? User interfaces need to embrace the company feel and identity.

2.  **How do your customers interact with your product or service** - this will determine the user experience with your product/service. Do your customers use your solution just once or is their usage reoccurring? Focus on your product's life cycle, all different stages and what does that mean to your customer in all stages. The answer to these questions will highlight the real issues and solutions.

3.  You might want to consider **developing user studies** to fully grasp and define suiting user flows, user experience, priorities and good-to-have's.

## Why is the design important for software and apps

A good design is not measured on how fancy it looks. A quality interface requires foremost to address the concerns and emotions of the users, considering what your business represents to them and the total product life cycle.

By following the above mentioned quality principles, petitcode will guarantee you adequate focus on what really matters. There is nothing worse than a slick design that does not answer to the user's needs and priorities.

## Why should you hire petitcode as an ecommerce agency for your digital marketplace

It's a known fact, that the number of physical stores is decreasing, whilst Ecommerce is still wildly booming. We all shop differently then compared to 10 years ago. We all plead guilty. That is why, many different digital marketplaces keep popping up and the generated revenues keep skyrocketing.

petitcode's collective originated from the flaws of this model and the ambition of solving these issues. Traditional agencies have several layers of experience: from interns, to juniors, seniors and executives. Most of the work is done by the lower levels and the higher levels end up having little involvement. From own experience, we confirm that agency-work is related to long hours, as if it were a contest of who spends the most time in the office. Additionally, the bigger the value-chain, the higher the costs and the higher the invoice you will be paying. petitcode believes in increasing productivity over extensive working hours and that any client deserves senior-level services.

With the senior advice of our collective of freelance professionals, you will be guided all the way to make technology and business savvy decisions that will keep bringing you ROI over time and boost your performance.
