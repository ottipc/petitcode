# petitcode - the senior level ecommerce agency berlin

Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange, inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. In shorter terms, **E-commerce** is the specific activity of buying or selling of products or services over the Internet. This means that E-commerce is a category of both Web and Mobile development.

## Quality principles for ecommerce strategy

### petitcode's creative approach

Whether you are a startup or an established business, we recommend to start with a thorough analysis of the number of products, forecasted quantities you intend to sell through your platform, who your customers are and what their buying habits are so that we can define which ecommerce solution best suits your needs. Together, we will follow the following steps:

1.  **Analyse your business** - According to your model (B2B, B2C, B2A, C2A, C2C, C2B); define your sales forecast for every product you want to sell on your ecommerce platform. Consider if you plan to continuously develop and sell more products as you may be better off in a more advanced technology.

2.  **How do your customers interact with your product or service** - according to each product, what is the level of urgency and, in case of unexpected delays, how can your customers contact you.

3.  You might want to consider **the development of user studies** to fully grasp and define suiting user flows, user experience, priorities and good-to-have's.

Feel free to contact us directly if you have any questions or would like to get started directly.

### Workflow for success in ecommerce

Petitcode's collective of senior freelancers structures its processes in three stages, especially the longer the projects:

1.  **BUILD** - We handcraft state-of-the-art ecommerce solutions suited to your strategy that will let you outperform competitors and even your own expectations.

2.  **MEASURE** - In accordance to the goals of each project, we build product and design strategies to monitor and analyse the success and evolution of your project.

3.  **LEARN** - Thanks to all the measurements made and the empirical learnings, the client, together with petitcode, will be able to make sound, evidence-based decision making.

## Choosing the right new tools

You know the names Magento, WooComerce, Shopware, Shopify, TYPO3, Oxid but you don't know the difference between them? Before going through countless comparisons of all existing ecommerce companies, tools and platforms - fyi: you will find top15s or top20s, but there are way more - simply get in touch with us and let us do it for you. That will save you a lot of hassle, time and energy.

Some ecommerce technologies have more integrations with other existing platforms due to existing business relationships. By analysing your business first, as mentioned previously, **choosing the right ecommerce technology for your business will be a no-brainer**.

## Why should you hire petitcode as an ecommerce agency for your digital marketplace

It's a known fact, that the number of physical stores is decreasing, whilst Ecommerce is still wildly booming. We all shop differently then compared to 10 years ago. We all plead guilty. That is why, many different digital marketplaces keep popping up and the generated revenues keep skyrocketing.

petitcode's collective originated from the flaws of this model and the ambition of solving these issues. Traditional agencies have several layers of experience: from interns, to juniors, seniors and executives. Most of the work is done by the lower levels and the higher levels end up having little involvement. From own experience, we confirm that agency-work is related to long hours, as if it were a contest of who spends the most time in the office. Additionally, the bigger the value-chain, the higher the costs and the higher the invoice you will be paying. petitcode believes in increasing productivity over extensive working hours and that any client deserves senior-level services.

With the senior advice of our collective of freelance professionals, you will be guided all the way to make technology and business savvy decisions that will keep bringing you ROI over time and boost your performance.
