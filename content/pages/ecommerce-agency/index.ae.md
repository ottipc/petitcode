# petitcode - the senior level digital marketing agency Dubai

Digital marketing is defined by the use of digital tactics and channels to connect with customers where they spend most of their time: online. From the website itself to a business's digital branding assets -- digital advertising, email marketing, online brochures, and beyond - there's a spectrum of options that fall under the category of digital marketing.

## Quality principles for digital marketing Dubai

petitcodeâ€™s collective of senior freelancers believes that choosing the right marketing channels heavily depends on your business, your clients, what type of products or services you sell, your forecasts and objectives. To do so successfully, the first priority is to define customer profiles to identify your audience and their needs.

### petitcode's creative approach

Whether you are a startup or an established business, we recommend to start with a thorough analysis of the number of products, forecasted quantities you intend to sell through your platform, who your customers are and what their buying habits are so that we can define which ecommerce solution best suits your needs. Together, we will follow the following steps:

1.  **Analyse your business** - According to your model (B2B, B2C, B2A, C2A, C2C, C2B); define your sales forecast for every product you want to sell on your ecommerce platform. Consider if you plan to continuously develop and sell more products as you may be better off in a more advanced technology.

2.  **How do your customers interact with your product or service** - according to each product, what is the level of urgency and, in case of unexpected delays, how can your customers contact you.

3.  You might want to consider **the development of user studies** to fully grasp and define suiting user flows, user experience, priorities and good-to-have's.

## Why should you hire petitcode as an ecommerce agency for your digital marketplace

It's a known fact, that the number of physical stores is decreasing, whilst Ecommerce is still wildly booming. We all shop differently then compared to 10 years ago. We all plead guilty. That is why, many different digital marketplaces keep popping up and the generated revenues keep skyrocketing.

petitcode's collective originated from the flaws of this model and the ambition of solving these issues. Traditional agencies have several layers of experience: from interns, to juniors, seniors and executives. Most of the work is done by the lower levels and the higher levels end up having little involvement. From own experience, we confirm that agency-work is related to long hours, as if it were a contest of who spends the most time in the office. Additionally, the bigger the value-chain, the higher the costs and the higher the invoice you will be paying. petitcode believes in increasing productivity over extensive working hours and that any client deserves senior-level services.

With the senior advice of our collective of freelance professionals, you will be guided all the way to make technology and business savvy decisions that will keep bringing you ROI over time and boost your performance.

## Workshop

If you are thinking about developing a digital marketing strategy or simply updating an existing one, we recommend a workshop first of all. After the first research and an intensive exchange with you, we can rationally work out which is the most suitable approach for the digital marketing campaign.

In a petitcode workshop, our senior freelancers will assess all development stages, define priorities and conceive a project timeline. As a result, you will receive a complete report of all items to consider, an accurate estimate of each task, subtask and the estimated total budget.
