###  Front End projects

**The difference** between generic front end app development and the best front end app development **is** **understanding which tools are best fit for specific tasks.** This will define whether the software will look slick or simply hacked. Front-end developers may also have design skills but it might not be their main skill.

###  Back End projects

The developer's task is to write, read, and process data from a database or any data source.

Considering that the back-end developer is responsible for building the architecture and internal design of the mobile application, a back-end developer needs to know much more about application architecture. petitcode's collective of senior freelancers has **only experienced Android and iOS developers** to offer.

### Mobile app design

When you are simply looking for the design of your product only, we recommend using the services of a design freelancer.

## Quality principles

It is petitcode’s strong belief that, in order to design and develop the best digital solutions for your business, it is important to consider several aspects and break down this process in steps:

1) Analyse your business - do you provide a product or a service? According to your Corporate Identity, how do you present yourself to your customers?

2) How do your customers interact with your product or service - this will determine the user experience with your product/service. Do your customers use your solution just once or is their usage recurring? Focus on your product’s life cycle, all different stages and what does that mean to your customer in all stages. The answer to these questions will highlight the real issues and solutions.

3) Technology stack - According to your resources and project, it might not even be needed to split the development according to devices. Thanks to native technologies, petitcode is able to develop your desired app with just one single code.
You might want to consider developing user studies to fully grasp and define suiting user flows, user experience, priorities and good-to-haves.

## Workshop

If you are thinking about developing an app or updating an existing one, we recommend a workshop first of all. After the first research and an intensive exchange with you, we can rationally work out which is the most suitable approach for the project.

In a petitcode workshop, our senior freelancers will assess all development stages, define priorities and conceive a project timeline. At the end, you will receive a complete report of all items to consider, an accurate estimate of each task, subtask and the estimated total budget.
