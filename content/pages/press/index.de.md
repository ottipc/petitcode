## Long Profile

It's not easy to tell when exactly the idea of starting petitecode, PC, came to Sebastian Melz. It might have started with his studies in Australia and developed after he founded the startup Find Some Buddy, FSB, along with 10 other people, and as much as he enjoyed working with the co-founders, Sebastian knew that he also wanted to go solo.

The exact date is 26.10.2015. petitcode sees the light after Sebastian launches the website using only WordPress. The concept was to create a network that connects freelancers together as well as with other companies. At the beginning, the idea of acquiring new clients seemed daunting, yet with some luck and a lot of hard work, petitcode managed to attract three clients in the first month, one of which was Jung von Matt, one of the biggest agencies in Germany.

Today, petitcode prides itself on the high-quality IT services it provides thanks to a professional team of senior developers–with some having more than 20 years of experience– and to a decentralized approach that gives the team the liberty to think outside the box. The agency has three business models:

### 1- Internal Development – Full- Service (from Idea to realisation)

Digital Strategies

Online/Offline Marketing

Development of all kinds

Design of all kinds

Copywriting

### 2- Freelance Matchmaking/Sourcing

### 3- Full-Time Equivalent/FTE Sourcing

What makes petitcode that attractive to join? Mehdi Alami, a PHP developer at petitcode, says "the most important thing to me, which I never experienced in any of my previous jobs, is that at petitcode, words are put into action. This is not just some company that claims it has flat hierarchies and then you're surprised when your boss doesn't seem to care for your opinion. Here at petitcode, my opinion carries as much weight as Sebastian's." It is no secret that a happy employee will deliver the best results. petitcode's clients are always glad to see their codes delivered to success and right on time.
