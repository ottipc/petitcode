## Medium Profile

After the rewarding experience in co-founding the startup Find Some Buddy, FSB, Sebastian Melz was now confident he can carry out solo work. In the summer of 2015, an idea comes to fruition: linking freelancers to other companies as well as to other freelancers under the umbrella brand petitcode, PC.
