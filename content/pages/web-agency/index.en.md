# Web development agency

In software architecture, whether web or mobile development, there are two perspectives. The back end is the server side, where all data is stored and where the business logic and rules of the software operate. The front end is the component controlled by the end user, the user interface, and serves as layer of make-up for the server side of the software.

Front end developers tend to get more credit because only their work is seen by the end users. Nevertheless, most of the existing code for any software will be predominantly back end based.

**The difference** between
generic front end development and senior front end development **is understanding
which tools are best fit for specific tasks.**
This will define whether the software will look slick or simply
hacked. Front-end developers may also have design skills but it might
not be their main skill. petitcode’s
collective of senior freelancers has **only
experienced front end developers**
to offer. If you are not sure which tools and platforms best suit
your business, simply [get in touch](/contact) with us.

The developer’s task is to write, read, and process data from a
database or any data source.

Considering that the back-end developer is responsible for building the
architecture and internal design of the website, a back-end developer
needs to know much more about website architecture. petitcode’s
collective of senior freelancers has **only
experienced back end developers**
to offer. If you are not sure which tools and platforms best suit
your business, simply [get in touch](http://de-en/contact) with us.

When you are simply looking for the design of your product only - whether
app, website, shop, etc - we recommend using the services of a
webdesign freelancer. As web design can be very subjective and
directly related to your own experiences and related emotions.
Finding the right designer is not just matching skills but also
reviewing portfolios, previous clients and listening to your gut
feeling.

If you are looking for a kick-ass designer, simply get in touch with us
and we will make sure to put you in touch with relevant freelancers.

# What makes petitcode different from other digital agencies?

petitcode’s collective originated from the flaws of this model and the ambition
of solving these issues. Traditional agencies have several layers of
human resources: from interns, to juniors, seniors and executives.
Most of the web development work is done by the lower levels and the
higher levels end up having little involvement. From own experience,
we confirm that agency-work is related to long hours, as if it were a
contest of who spends the most time in the office. Additionally, the
bigger the value-chain, the higher the costs and the higher the
invoice you will be paying.

petitcode believes in increasing productivity over extensive working hours and
that any client deserves senior-level web design and development
services. By choosing petitcode you will be in direct communication
with the freelancer, with no hidden layers. Simply get in touch with
us and let’s get the project started.
