# Web development agency

In software architecture, whether web or mobile development, there are two perspectives. The back end is the server side, where all data is stored and where the business logic and rules of the software operate. The front end is the component controlled by the end user, the user interface, and serves as layer of make-up for the server side of the software.

Front end developers tend to get more credit because only their work is seen by the end users. Nevertheless, most of the existing code for any software will be predominantly back end based.

**The difference** between
generic front end development and senior front end development **is understanding
which tools are best fit for specific tasks.**
This will define whether the software will look slick or simply
hacked. Front-end developers may also have design skills but it might
not be their main skill. petitcode’s
collective of senior freelancers has **only
experienced front end developers**
to offer. If you are not sure which tools and platforms best suit
your business, simply [get in touch](#contact) with us.

The developer’s task is to write, read, and process data from a
database or any data source.

Considering that the back-end developer is responsible for building the
architecture and internal design of the website, a back-end developer
needs to know much more about website architecture. petitcode’s
collective of senior freelancers has **only
experienced back end developers**
to offer. If you are not sure which tools and platforms best suit
your business, simply [get in touch](http://de-en/contact) with us.

When you are simply looking for the design of your product only - whether
app, website, shop, etc - we recommend using the services of a
webdesign freelancer. As web design can be very subjective and
directly related to your own experiences and related emotions.
Finding the right designer is not just matching skills but also
reviewing portfolios, previous clients and listening to your gut
feeling.

If you are looking for a kick-ass designer, simply get in touch with us
and we will make sure to put you in touch with relevant freelancers.

## Quality principles

It is petitcode’s strong belief that, in order to design and develop the best digital solutions for your business, it is important to consider several aspects and break down this process in steps:

1. Analyse your business - do you provide a product or a service? According to your Corporate Identity, how do you present yourself to your customers? What technology stack do you use? Are there any changes/updates worth considering?
2. How do your customers interact with your product or service - this will determine the user experience with your product/service. Do your customers use your solution just once or is their usage recurring? Focus on your product’s life cycle, all different stages and what does that mean to your customer in all stages. The answer to these questions will highlight the real issues and solutions.

You might want to consider developing user studies to fully grasp and define suiting user flows, user experience, priorities and good-to-haves.

## Workshop

If you are thinking about developing a web solution or updating an existing one, we recommend a workshop first of all. After the first research and an intensive exchange with you, we can rationally work out which is the most suitable approach for the project.

In a <Link humanId = "article-2"> petitcode workshop</Link>, our senior freelancers will assess all development stages, define priorities and conceive a project timeline. At the end, you will receive a complete report of all items to consider, an accurate estimate of each task, subtask and the estimated total budget.

# What makes petitcode different from other web design agencies Dubai?

petitcode’s collective originated from the flaws of this model and the ambition of solving these issues. Traditional agencies have several layers of human resources: from interns, to juniors, seniors and executives. Most of the web development work is done by the lower levels, and the higher levels end up having little involvement. From our own experience, we can confirm that agency-work is related to long hours, as if it were a contest of who spends the most time in the office. Additionally, the bigger the value-chain, the higher the costs and the higher the invoice you will be paying. 

petitcode believes in increasing productivity over extensive working hours and that every client deserves senior-level web design and development services. By choosing petitcode you will be in direct communication with the freelancer, with no hidden layers. Simply get in touch with us and let’s get the project started.
